C02 driver guts

---

BLOCK DEVICE DRIVERS provide nothing more than raw read/write functions
and various device information functions such as size of device and
raw device sector size.  Device-specific functions may appear on a
per-driver basis.  Devices can be locked when in use.

FILESYSTEM DEVICE DRIVERS provide a file-based interface that provides
open, close, block read, block write, delete, rename, etc. functions.
These drivers are intermediaries between the VFS and the individual
block device drivers.  The VFS provides a block device number, an operation
type, and a pathname or file handle to the individual filesystem driver.
The filesystem driver gives the VFS a driver-specific file handle number
when a file is opened.  When VFS does a mount of a specific FS, the FS
driver's mount functions are called to allow it to initialize the FS for
reading.

THE VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM (VFS)
VFS maps pathnames to their proper filesystem drivers and hands out handles
for opened files independent of the one given by the specific FS driver.
VFS also mounts and unmounts filesystems on the root FS.

BLOCK CACHING SUBSYSTEM
Eventually, a block cache will be implemented that intercepts all calls to
a block device driver and provides caching functionality.
