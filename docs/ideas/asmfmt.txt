C02 Assembly File Format
========================


OUTPUT FORMAT OPTIONS
---------------------

link=[type]

  Sets the default output format of the assembled code.  Valid values for
  [type] include:

  * dynamic - Full dynamic-link, relocatable code
  * static - Relocatable code with all dependent libraries pre-linked
             as part of the output file.
  * locked - All program code is pre-linked and pre-located to a specified
             fixed address in memory.  This is only useful for code that
             can't be loaded anywhere else and/or does not have a dynamic
             linker available at load time.  (A dynamic linker that will
             load the OS components to boot it is an example of such code.)

start=[address]

  Only valid for "link=locked" set.  This determines the starting address
  of the code output by the toolchain.
