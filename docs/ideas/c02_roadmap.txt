C02 Development Roadmap
-----------------------

* Decide on an ABI
* Create an object file format
* Write a compiler in BASIC for a C-ish language, and develop the system in this language
* Write a toolchain around this compiler, also in BASIC
* Rewrite the kernel core using this compiler
* Write a program loader for the object format and incorporate it into the kernel
* Write a special version of the loader that can boot the system for each applicable architecture
* Rewrite the compiler using itself
* Bootstrap the new compiler
* Write a complete toolchain around the compiler
