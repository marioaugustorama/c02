C02 modified FAT16 file system

Sector 0 = Boot sector (C128 etc.)

Sector 1 = FS information table
  $00-$06 = "C02FAT16" signature
  $07 = Cluster size (256-byte block multiple)
        $01 = 1 block per cluster, $04 = 4 blocks, etc.
  $08/$09 = Sector number for FAT start
  $10/$11 = Size of FAT at time of creation (in clusters)
  $12/$13 = First cluster number of root directory start
  $14-$25 = 16-byte disk volume label (null-terminated)
  $26-$ff = Reserved

Sector 2 = default FAT start

FAT entries are 16 bits (2 bytes) long.
$0000 = Free space
$0001-$FFFA = Used space + Pointer to next cluster in file
$FFFD = Unusable cluster
$FFFE = Reserved cluster (FAT area, etc.)
$FFFF = Used space and EOF (End of File)
FAT entries past the FAT size indicated in the FS info table are
to be filled with "reserved."

Directory entry structure:

Every file's directory entry consists of a 24-byte name, a 2-byte
starting cluster, a 4-byte file length, an attribute byte, and a
reserved byte which should be zero.  Eight file names can be stored
in every 256-byte block.

When a file system is created, the number of clusters that will be
available can be determined by the following steps:

1. Subtract two sectors from the total number of sectors involved
2. Divide this number by the number of sectors per cluster
3. Strip off any non-integer components of the result
This is the number of clusters in the file system.

Determining the number of clusters used by the FAT is simple.
Divide the number of clusters in the file system by 128.  This is the
number of 256-byte blocks required for the FAT.  Further divide this
by the cluster multiplier.  Round up to the next highest size if the
result is not an integer quantity.
Note that the FAT will be included in itself as reserved clusters.
Also, the unused area of the FAT must be filled with "reserved"
entries.
