To build C02 on a DOS or Windows system with ACME installed
in the system PATH, simply run BUILD.BAT in the C02 folder.

Documentation on how to write up BUILD.CFG for your system
is available in the DOCS folder.  BUILD.CFG example files are
available in the CONFIGS folder.

Sample bootstrapping code to start C02 on a system that is not
booting directly into a C02 ROM can be found in BOOT.

TEMP is either empty or has useless junk in it.

TEST contains code that can be used to test that various
functions are working properly.

All remaining folders are system code of some form or another.
